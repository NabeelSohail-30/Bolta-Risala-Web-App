اَلْحَمْدُ للهِ رَبِّ العَالَمِينْ وَالصَّلاةُ والسَّلامُ على سَيِّدِ الْمُرْسلِينْ اَمَّا بعد فَاعُوذُ بِلّٰهِ من الشَيْطانِ الرَّجِيمْ بِسْمِ اللهِ الرَّحْمانِرَّحِيمْ

One Hundred Needs will be fulfilled:
The Beloved and Blessed Prophet صلى الله تعالى عليه وسلم has said, 'One who recites Ṣalāt upon me on the day and night of Friday, Allah عَزَّوَجَلْ will fulfill his 100 needs; 70 of the Hereafter and 30 of the world, and Allah عَزَّوَجَلْ will appoint an angel who will convey the Ṣalāt to my grave in such a way as gifts are presented to you. No doubt, even after I depart this life, my knowledge will remain the same as it is in my life.'

صَلُّوۡا عَلَى الۡحَبِيۡب صَلَّلّٰهُ تَعَالٰى عَلٰى مُحَمَّد

الحمد لله عَزَّوَجَلْ!  I (Sag-e-Madinah) came to know about Imām-e-Aĥl-e-Sunnat Shāĥ Imām Aḥmad Razā Khān عليه رحمة الرحمن in my childhood. As I grew up, the devotion towards Aala Ḥaḍrat رحمة الله تعالى عليه inculcated in my heart. I fearlessly say لَوْمةَ لَاءِمْ, (that is, without fearing for the reproach of anyone) that I have recognized Allah عَزَّوَجَلْ through the Beloved Prophet صَلَّى اللهُ تَعَالٰى عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم, and similarly I did recognize the Beloved Prophet صَلَّى اللهُ تَعَالٰى عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم through Aala Ḥaḍratرحمة الله تعالى عليه. When I felt an overwhelming desire to join his spiritual-lineage, only one eminent personality became the focus of my attention. However, there was no shortage of Mashāikh Aĥl-e-Sunnat at that time and not even today, but it is a matter of personal choice. I knew that I could become a direct Murīd of Aala Ḥaḍrat رحمة الله تعالى عليه through one medium only by that sacred personality. And his charismatic personality also had another attraction that he رحمة الله تعالى عليه was receiving direct blessings from the shade of Gumbad-e-Khazrā [that is, he رحمة الله تعالى عليه had the privilege of residing in the blessed city of Madinah].

The dignified personality I am talking about is Allama Maulana Ziauddin Madani Qadri Razavi رحمة الله تعالى عليه. I made a firm intention to become his Murid (disciple) at any cost. Therefore, somehow I obtained his home address in Madina Munawwara probably in the year 1396 Hijri.

After I had found the address, I told one of my considerate fellows 'late Muhammad Adam Barkati' that I had decided to pledge spiritual bond (Bay’at) via Sayyidi Qutbe Madina رحمة الله تعالى عليه by postal mail. Brother Adam (Late) said, 'You live in Karachi and he is in Madina. You have not seen him yet. How would you form the image of Shaikh?' I replied, 'It is not a difficult thing to do. If he is a genuine spiritual guide, he can solve this problem through a dream; apparent distance cannot become an obstacle against blessings and favours.'

The same night (10 Rabi unNoor) when I fell asleep, fortune smiled on me and by the grace of Allah عَزَّوَجَلْ, in fact, I saw my future spiritual guide in my dream, and he رحمة الله تعالى عليه appeared in full glory as long as I saved his image in my mind properly; الحمد لله عَزَّوَجَلْ, the same image is still safe in my mind today. I happily went to the caliph of Sayyidi Qutbe Madina Alhaaj Allama Maulana Hafiz Qari Muhammad Muslihuddin Siddiqi Qadri عَـلَيْهِ رَحْـمَةُ الـلّٰـهِ الۡـقَـوِی and told him my dream.

He رحمة الله تعالى عليه enquired about the appearance of Sayyidi Qutbe Madina رحمة الله تعالى عليه. I related whatever I dreamt, he verified it as Qari Sahib had visited Sayyidi Qutbe Madina رحمة الله تعالى عليه many a time in Madina Munawwara. Then I had a letter written from Qari Sahib for pledging allegiance (Bay’at) and sent it to Madina from Karachi, but did not receive any reply. I sent the same type of letter few more times but received no reply. I was not amongst those who would give up.

Eventually, fortune smiled on me after one year and five days, I saw him in my dream. I was astounded at this matter that neither he رحمة الله تعالى عليه accepted me as his Mureed nor did he رحمة الله تعالى عليه divert his attention away from me. But I did not know that the waiting time had been over. I saw him in my dream that night then the next day after Salatul Maghrib I learnt that a letter of acceptance from my spiritual guide living in sacred city Madina has arrived اَلۡحَمۡدُلِلّٰهِ عَلٰي اِحۡسَانِه.

Then in 1400 Hijri, by the blessings and favours of the Beloved and Blessed Prophet صَلَّى اللهُ تَعَالٰى عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم, I landed at Jeddah airport and reached Madina Munawwara along with my Peer brother (follower of the same spiritual guide) Sakinay Madina (residing in Madina) Alhaaj Sufi Muhammad Iqbal Qadri Razvi Ziae by car. Having paid Salaam in the blessed court of the Beloved Prophet صَلَّى اللهُ تَعَالٰى عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم, I visited the blessed residence of my spiritual guide. When I saw my spiritual guide, my heart witnessed that it was the same luminous face which I had seen in my dream in Baabul Madina, Karachi الحمد لله عَزَّوَجَلْ.

الحمد لله عَزَّوَجَلْ, I had stayed in Madina Munawwara almost for two months. Over this period of time, I would attend Mehfile Naat (Naat reciting gathering), that used to be held at the blessed residence. I had the privilege to visit the blessed residence of Murshid many times in the evening. When the tormenting and heart-rending time of departing from Madina came, I grew extremely sad. I start moving to the blessed court of the Beloved Prophet صلى الله تعالى عليه وسلم to pay my farewell Salaam in a state of immense grief. I was moving forward kissing the doors and walls and fruits and leaves down the street [with my eyes] visiting Madina Munawwara like this and bless me with the burial in Jannat-ul-Baqii at the feet of my spiritual guide.

صَلُّوۡا عَلَى الۡحَبِيۡب صَلَّى اللّٰهُ تَعَالٰى عَلٰى مُحَمَّد

Dastaar Bandi (tying the turban) by Imame Ahle Sunnat
Sayyidi Qutbe Madina رحمة الله تعالى عليه was born in 1877 at 'Kalaswala' of district Ziakot (Sialkot is called ‘Ziakot’ in relation to Ziauddin in the Madani environment of Dawate Islami), Pakistan. He رحمة الله تعالى عليه is lineal descendant of Sayyiduna Siddiqe Akbar رَضِىَ اللهُ تَعَالا عَـنْهُ. He رحمة الله تعالى عليه received his early education in Ziakot (Sialkot), then for some time in Markazul Aulia (Lahore) and Chokhate Khuwaja (Delhi). He رحمة الله تعالى عليه, then, under the supervision of Allama Maulana Wasi Ahmed Muhaddis Suraati عَـلَيْهِ رَحْـمَةُ الـلّٰـهِ الـقَـوِی in Pilibhit (U.P. India), spent 4 years and acquired religious education.

After completing Daurae Hadees, he رحمة الله تعالى عليه received his degree. الحمد لله عَزَّوَجَلْ, Imame Ahle Sunnat رحمة الله تعالى عليه performed the Dastaar Bandi of Qutbe Madina رحمة الله تعالى عليه with his blessed hands. He رحمة الله تعالى عليه also pledged allegiance/took Bay’at from Imame Ahle Sunnat رحمة الله تعالى عليه and got the certificate of Khilaafat just at the age of eighteen.

From Baabul Madina to Baghdad
In 1900, (1318 Hijri), when Sayyidi Qutbe Madina رحمة الله تعالى عليه was 24 years of age, he رحمة الله تعالى عليه took leave of his Murshid Imame Ahle Sunnat رحمة الله تعالى عليه and came to Baabul Madina, Karachi. Having spent some time here, he رحمة الله تعالى عليه went to Baghdad in order to get special blessings and favours from Sayyiduna Ghouse Aazam عليهِ رَحمةُ اللهِ الْاَكْرَمْ. In Baghdad, he رحمة الله تعالى عليه had been utterly absorbed into divine meditation for almost 4 years. He رحمة الله تعالى عليه remained in the illuminated city of Baghdad approximately for 9 years and some months.

Visit of sacred Madina
In 1327 Hijri (1910), Sayyidi Qutbe Madina رحمة الله تعالى عليه entered Madina Tayyiba following the route of Damascus (Syria) by train. Turkish rulers used to 'serve' Madina Tayyiba in those days.

Starved for seven days
Sayyidi Qutbe Madina رحمة الله تعالى عليه said, 'When I arrived at Madina, I experienced such a time that I had to starve for 7 days in the beginning. On the seventh day, when I got very weak due to hunger, a very dignified saint came to me and gave me three bags and left saying that he would bring some more things for me from the market. The first bag contained honey, second flour and the third one ghee. After some time, he brought me a packet of tea, sugar, etc., and returned immediately. I ran after him so that I could ask him the details, but he had disappeared. Qutbe Madina رحمة الله تعالى عليه was asked humbly about that person. He رحمة الله تعالى عليه replied, 'I presume that he might be the uncle of the Beloved Prophet صَلَّى اللهُ تَعَالٰى عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم Sayyidush Shuhada Sayyiduna Hamza رَضِىَ اللهُ تَعَالا عَـنْهُ because he رَضِىَ اللهُ تَعَالا عَـنْهُ has been entrusted with the Wilaayat (sainthood) of Madina Munawwara.

Dear Islamic brothers! Sayyidi Qutbe Madina رحمة الله تعالى عليه had a great devotion to Sayyiduna Hamza رَضِىَ اللهُ تَعَالا عَـنْهُ. He would celebrate the 'Urs of Sayyiduna Hamza رَضِىَ اللهُ تَعَالا عَـنْهُ every year on 17 Ramadanul-Mubarak and would break his one fast at the shrine of Sayyiduna Hamza رَضِىَ اللهُ تَعَالا عَـنْهُ.

You are welcome!
Sayyidi Qutbe Madina رحمة الله تعالى عليه was an eminent practicing scholar. Indeed, it was Sayyidi Qutbe Madina رحمة الله تعالى عليه who only could endure the severe hardships during the stay in Baghdad and while residing in Madina Tayyiba after leaving his hometown. He رحمة الله تعالى عليه was extremely well-mannered and sociable. Whenever anyone would visit him, he رحمة الله تعالى عليه would very often utter 'Marhaba Marhaba' loudly. الحمد لله عَزَّوَجَلْ, likewise, when Sag-e-Madina used to visit him, he رحمة الله تعالى عليه would say 'Marhaba brother Ilyaas! Marhaba brother Ilyaas!’ By doing this he رحمة الله تعالى عليه would please me much. He رحمة الله تعالى عليه was very hospitable and humble/meek. Sag-e-Madina عُـفِیَ عَـنۡـهُ observed it repeatedly that whenever he رحمة الله تعالى عليه was requested to make Duaa, he رحمة الله تعالى عليه would state, 'I pray for you and request you to pray for me as well.'

Everyday Mehfil-e-Milaad Sayyidi Qutbe Madina رحمة الله تعالى عليه had a deep devotion to the Beloved Prophet صَلَّى اللهُ تَعَالٰى عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم. Here it would not be wrong to say that he رحمة الله تعالى عليه was an ardent devotee of the Beloved Rasool. Zikr-e-Rasool صَلَّى اللهُ تَعَالٰى عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم was his consuming passion. He رحمة الله تعالى عليه would frequently ask the pilgrims a question 'Do you recite Na’at?' If the pilgrim said 'yes', he, then, would listen to his Na’at and enjoy much. Many a time, tears streamed down his face due to being emotional. Mehfil-e-Naat used to be held at his blessed residence daily throughout the year; pilgrims from Madina, Turkey, Pakistan, India, Syria, Egypt, Africa, Sudan and from all over the world would attend it. الحمد لله عَزَّوَجَلْ Sag-e-Madina عُـفِیَ عَـنۡـهُ had the privilege to recite Na’at in this sacred Mehfil (gathering) many times.

One thing that Sag-e-Madina عُـفِیَ عَـنۡـهُ observed in the Mehfil of Qutbe Madina is that he رحمة الله تعالى عليه did not use to lead Duaa at the end of the Mehfil showing humbleness, but rather asked any of the attendees to lead the Duaa. Once or twice I was also privileged to lead Duaa in accordance with the saying: 'the order is superior to respect' to have the opportunity of leading the Duaa at the end of the Mehfil. Blessed Langar [food served to offer Isaale Sawaab] used to be arranged daily after the Duaa.'

No greed, no refusal, and no accumulation!
Sayyidi Qutbe Madina رحمة الله تعالى عليه was a noble-minded and noble-natured saint. He رحمة الله تعالى عليه was very generous, affectionate and loving and would remind us of Salfe Saliheen (pious predecessors رَحِمَهُمُ الـلّٰـهُ تَـعَالٰی). He رحمة الله تعالى عليه used to state, 'No greed, no refusal, no accumulation.' It implies that do not be greedy that someone will give you something and if someone gives you something without your asking, so do not refuse him, and when you take it, do not save it.

If someone presented him a perfume, he رحمة الله تعالى عليه would be pleased and make Duaa like this: عَطَّرَ اللّٰهُ اَيَّامَكُم, i.e., May Allah عَزَّوَجَلْ make your days fragrant. He رحمة الله تعالى عليه showed a deep devotion to the Beloved Prophet صَلَّى اللهُ تَعَالٰى عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم and Sayyiduna Ghause Azam عَـلَيْـهِ رَحْـمَةُ الـلّٰـهِ الۡاَ کۡرَم.

Help from Ghauš-e-A’ẓam عَلَيۡهِ رَحۡمَةُ اللّٰهِ الۡاَكۡرَم
Sayyidī Quṭb-e-Madīnaĥ رَحْمَةُ اللهِ تَعَالٰی عَلَيْه said, ‘Once I suffered from paralysis that affected my half of the body. My illness was very severe, everyone thought that I would no longer survive. One night, I made a request to the Beloved Prophet صَلَّى اللهُ تَعَالٰى عَلَيْهِ وَاٰلِهٖ وَسَلَّم, weeping: Yā Rasūlallāĥ صَلَّى اللهُ تَعَالٰى عَلَيْهِ وَاٰلِهٖ وَسَلَّم! I have been sent to you by my Murshid Imām Aḥmad Razā Khān عَـلَيْهِ رَحْمَةُ الـرَّحْمٰن as a servant. If this illness is a punishment for any of my mistakes, please forgive me for the sake of my Murshid.

Likewise, I made a request to Sayyidunā Ghauš-e-Pāk and Khuwājaĥ Gharīb Nawāz رَحِمَهُمَا الـلّٰـهُ تَـعَالٰی. When I fell asleep, what I saw was that my Murshid A’lā Ḥaḍrat Imām Aḥmad Razā Khān عَـلَيْهِ رَحْمَةُ الـرَّحْمٰن came to me along with two luminous-faced saints. Pointing at one saint, A’lā Ḥaḍrat رَحْمَةُ اللهِ تَعَالٰی عَلَيْه said, ‘Ziyāuddīn! Look! He is Sayyidunā Ghauš-e-A’ẓam عَـلَيْـهِ رَحْـمَةُ الـلّٰـهِ الۡاَکۡرَم’, then pointing at the other saint, he رَحْمَةُ الـلّٰـهِ تَـعَـالٰی عَـلَيْـه said, ‘He is Sayyidunā Khuwājaĥ Gharīb Nawāz رَحْمَةُ اللهِ تَعَالٰی عَلَيْه.’ Sayyidunā Ghauš-e-A’ẓam عَـلَيْـهِ رَحْـمَةُ الـلّٰـهِ الۡاَکۡرَم moved his healing hand over my paralytic body and said, ‘Get up!’ I rose in my dream. Then these three saints رَحِمَهُمُ الـلّٰـهُ تَـعَالٰی started offering Ṣalāĥ. I woke up. اَلْـحَمْـدُ لـِلّٰـه عَزَّوَجَلَّ, I recovered.

May Allah عَزَّوَجَلَّ have mercy upon them and bless us for their sake!

Help from Mustafa صَلَّی اللّٰہ تعالٰی علیہ واٰلہٖ وسلَّم
Sayyidī Quṭb-e-Madīnaĥ رَحْمَةُ الـلّٰـهِ تَـعَـالٰی عَـلَيْـه has stated: Many endeavours/efforts were made to expel me from Madīnaĥ (in the sacred crime of arranging Maḥfil-e-Mīlād[1]). However, when I would visit the blessed court of the Beloved Prophet  صَلَّى اللهُ تَعَالٰى عَلَيْهِ وَاٰلِهٖ وَسَلَّم and make my supplication so, somehow or the other, I would be able to remain in Madīnaĥ. Once the police threw my possession out of my home! I was standing in the street, worried. As the attention of the police diverted         I went anxiously to the blessed court of the Beloved Prophet صَلَّى اللهُ تَعَالٰى عَلَيْهِ وَاٰلِهٖ وَسَلَّم and submitted my request in tears. When I was a little relaxed, I returned to my street, and found that the police had themselves kept my possessions back in my house and I was informed that my exile-order from the city had been cancelled.

Yā Rasūlallāĥ صَلَّی اللّٰہ تعالٰی علیہ واٰلہٖ وسلَّم! Where I have been trapped!
Undoubtedly, the Prophet of Raḥmaĥ, the Intercessor of Ummaĥ, the Owner of Jannaĥ صَلَّى اللهُ تَعَالٰى عَلَيْهِ وَاٰلِهٖ وَسَلَّم is always very kind to his guests. In 1400 AH, (1980) I (Sag-e-Madīnaĥ), for the first time, visited the sacred Madīnaĥ زَادَھَـا الـلّٰـهُ شَـرَفًـا وَّ تَـعۡـظِیۡـمًا. Perhaps it was the first or second night of the visit of Madīnaĥ زَادَھَـا الـلّٰـهُ شَـرَفًـا وَّ تَـعۡـظِیۡـمًا. Much part of the night had passed. I was enjoying the spiritual view of Gumbad-e-Khazrā outside Masjid-un-Nabawī near the door of Jibrāīl عَـلَيْـهِ الـسَّـلَام in a way that sometimes I would move forward devotedly towards Gumbad-e-Khazrā and sometimes I would move taking some steps backwards. After a while an on-duty policeman called me and grabbed me; his fellow policeman was dozing leaning against the wall. He kicked his fellow policeman and asked him to get up; his fellow policeman all at once aiming his gun at me stood in front of me! One policeman started pulling my ‘Zulfayn’ (Sunnaĥ-conforming long hair).

Perhaps the terrorists, who had seized Ka’baĥ and committed sacrilege to it a year or two years back causing acute agitation and grief among the Muslims of the entire world, had long hair and the police considered me their gang member.

They asked me to show them my passport, but unfortunately   I did not have my passport that time. It was at my residence.   I was, that time, in deep trouble. Both policemen took me to a small room; unlocked it and started pushing me inside it. Much part of the night had passed. I desperately needed to pass urine which worried me as to how I would be able to offer Ṣalāt-ul-Fajr after performing Ṭaĥārat (washing private parts) and Wuḍū inside that small room! I got confused and in the state of confusion, I spontaneously uttered some words of supplication in my own mother-tongue ‘Memoni’; the English translation of the words is: Yā Rasūlallāĥ صَلَّى اللهُ تَعَالٰى عَلَيْهِ وَاٰلِهٖ وَسَلَّم! Where I have been trapped!

I got further scared as I uttered ‘Yā Rasūlallāĥ صَلَّى اللهُ تَعَالٰى عَلَيْهِ وَاٰلِهٖ وَسَلَّم!’ Therefore I thought that they would torture me badly because unfortunately the governing class has no regard for those who utter ‘Yā Rasūlallāĥ صَلَّى اللهُ تَعَالٰى عَلَيْهِ وَاٰلِهٖ وَسَلَّم’, but what a favour bestowed upon me! As I uttered Yā Rasūlallāĥ صَلَّى اللهُ تَعَالٰى عَلَيْهِ وَاٰلِهٖ وَسَلَّم, the police started laughing after noticing my state of helplessness and nervousness. Then they released me and locked the door of the small room.

صَلُّوۡا عَلَى الۡحَبِيۡب           صَلَّى اللّٰهُ تَعَالٰى عَلٰى مُحَمَّد

Arrival of invisible (spiritual) personalities
Sayyidī Quṭb-e-Madīnaĥ رَحْمَةُ الـلّٰـهِ تَعَالٰی عَـلَيْه had been in a very strange state of mind two months before his demise. Whatever he رَحْمَةُ اللهِ تَعَالٰی عَلَيْه said could not be understood. Sometimes, he  رَحْمَةُ اللهِ تَعَالٰی عَلَيْه said the following words repeatedly. ‘Your majesty, please come! Please come!’ Once, the audience saw him beseeching someone earnestly with both hands together, ‘Please forgive me; due to weakness I am unable to stand up for your reverence.’

After sometimes upon audience’s questioning, he رَحْمَةُ اللهِ تَعَالٰی عَلَيْه said, ‘Just now Sayyidunā Khiḍr عَـلٰى نَبِـيِّـنَا وَ عَـلَيْـهِ الـصَّلٰوة ُ وَالـسَّلَام, Sayyidunā Ghauš-e-A’ẓam رَحْمَةُ اللهِ تَعَالٰی عَلَيْه and my spiritual guide A’lā Ḥaḍrat Imām Aḥmad Razā Khān عَـلَيْهِ رَحْمَةُ الـرَّحْمٰن have visited me.’

Demise and blessed funeral
On Friday, 4th Żul-Ḥijja-til-Ḥarām, 1401 AH (02-10-81), as the Muażżin of Masjid-un-Nabawī uttered ‘اَللّٰهُ اَكۡبَرُ اَللّٰهُ اَكۡبَرُ’, Sayyidī Quṭb-e-Madīnaĥ رَحْمَةُ اللهِ تَعَالٰی عَلَيْه recited Kalimaĥ and then departed this world ‘اِنَّا لِلّٰهِ وَ اِنَّآ اِلَيۡهِ رٰجِعُوۡنَ’.

Having given a bath, shroud was spread and under the blessed head of Quṭb-e-Madīnaĥ رَحْمَةُ اللهِ تَعَالٰی عَلَيْه the sacred dust of the blessed Ḥujraĥ-e-Maqṣūraĥ of the Beloved and Blessed Prophet صَلَّى اللهُ تَعَالٰى عَلَيْهِ وَاٰلِهٖ وَسَلَّم was kept. The blessed Ghussālaĥ [the blessed water poured over the sacred grave] of the Beloved Prophet’s صَلَّى اللهُ تَعَالٰى عَلَيْهِ وَاٰلِهٖ وَسَلَّم luminous grave and many other sacred relics were also kept. Then the blessed shroud was tied. The blessed bier was lifted after Ṣalāt-ul-‘Aṣr in the echoes of Ṣalāt-‘Alan-Nabī صَلَّى اللهُ تَعَالٰى عَلَيْهِ وَاٰلِهٖ وَسَلَّم and Qaṣīdaĥ Burdaĥ.

Eventually, Sayyidī Quṭb-e-Madīnaĥ رَحْمَةُ اللهِ تَعَالٰی عَلَيْه, according    to his will, was buried in the presence of countless mourners at the place of Jannat-ul-Baqī’ where the Aĥl-e-Bayt-e-Aṭĥār رَضِىَ الـلّٰـهُ تَعَالٰی عَـنْهُم are resting. He رَحْمَةُ اللهِ تَعَالٰی عَلَيْه was buried just at a distance of two yards from the sacred shrine of Sayyida-tun-Nisā Fāṭima-tuz-Zaĥrā رَضِیَ الـلّٰـهُ تَـعَالٰی عَـنْـهَا.

May Allah عَزَّوَجَلَّ have mercy upon him and forgive us for his sake!

صَلُّوۡا عَلَى الۡحَبِيۡب           صَلَّى اللّٰهُ تَعَالٰى عَلٰى مُحَمَّد

Seven sayings of Quṭb-e-Madīnaĥ
1. One who does not follow Sharī’aĥ is not worthy of Tarīqaĥ.
2. Profound love for desires is a fatal companion and a bad habit is a great enemy.
3. It is the defect of one’s mind if he likes his own work.
4. Seek refuge of Allah عَزَّوَجَلَّ from the lust for wealth because one gains consciousness after it’s too late.
5. The world is a very bad place; one who falls into its trap once, he ensnared further and further into it, and one who gets away from it, it is after him.
6. The ability to perform a righteous deed is indeed a sign   of answering one’s prayers.
7. If someone’s letter is read or he is mentioned or his name is called in Madīnaĥ Munawwaraĥ زَادَھَـا الـلّٰـهُ شَـرَفًـا وَّ تَـعۡـظِیۡـمًا, so it is his good fortune!
